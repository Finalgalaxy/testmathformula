# testmathformula
Easy java accurate test for checking comparison with a new formula to an existing one.

I had to check comparison between n^2 and Luca di Mauro (Very nice italian genius ;D) formula to find in alternative way the same result using (n-250)^1000 + (n-500)^2.

Testing from 0 to Long.MAX_VALUE in java, providing accuracy on long outputs.
Yes, the formula works perfectly, I told you he is a genius lol...
